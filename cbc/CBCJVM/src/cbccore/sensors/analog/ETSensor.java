/**
 * Calculates a distance in centimeters based of the value given by a floating
 * analog sensor port. The ETSensor's values are approximately inversely
 * proportional to the actual distance, and with some calibration, this class
 * can use that relationship to solve for the actual distance. See the
 * ETCalibrator test, which will give you k, power, and b required by the
 * constructor. The class also contains calibration information collected by the
 * programmer for his own sensor. This should only be used for prototyping, and
 * you should do the calibration process yourself, as values could vary greatly
 * from sensor to sensor.
 * <p>
 * The formula used is: <code>distance=k/Math.pow(analog10Value, power)+b</code>
