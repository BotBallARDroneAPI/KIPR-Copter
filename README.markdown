Current Stable Release: 10.7; Next stable release not yet planned
-----------

It is recommended that you stick with the development/git version and report bugs as you find them. The last stable version lacks many of those of the development version. Personally, I would suggest updating your copy of CBCJVM up until a week or so before the competition, upon which time I suggest you institute your own local freeze for stability. We may eventually move to a rolling-release model.

First off, remember that by following these instructions you may brick your CBC and void your warranty.  You have been warned.
CBCv2 ONLY
